## Task 2: Search for an element in the array. 

Take 2 integer numbers from the console: 

- array size `n` and 
- number to search `i` in the array

Generate random array of integers of size `n` and print it. Verify if the element `i` is present in the array, if it does, print `true`, otherwise print `false` 

Use several search algorithms. For example: 

- regular search one by one;
- binary search 

Compare exection time.

## Task 4: Find Minimum

Create a class `FindMinimum` with the following methods:

1. `findMin` that takes 2 integer arguments and returns the lowest
2. `findMin` that takes 2 integer arguments and returns the lowest (using the first method)
3. `findMin` that takes 2 integer arguments and returns the lowest (using the previous method)
